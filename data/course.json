Topics include the basics of deep neural networks and how to set up and train them, convolutional networks to process images and videos, transformers for natural language processing, generative large language models (such as ChatGPT), and text-to-image models (such as MidJourney). Prior familiarity with Python and fundamental machine learning concepts (such as training/validation/testing, overfitting/underfitting, and regularization) is required.",
